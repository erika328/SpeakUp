is your lucky day mr. Bowmont
the gentleman daysailer has just become
available again and I believe that you
made a bid of $18,000 yeah you have to
pay that it's not just a guess
I was actually relieved I didn't win the
boat my wife would have killed me what
is your wife's name it's Pam
Pam oh okay just imagine this the Pam oh
I don't think she'd like that okay
imagine this the mr. Bowmont I don't
think so dear
okay look let me paint you a little
picture alright you are setting sail up
the Hudson you got the wind in your hair
you get all that peace and quiet that
you've always wanted you get back to
nature
you can go fishing you in doing the
little hats and have people call you
captain and then when you're old
CACI what the hell it's for a good cause
alright oh why it's mine what
all that stuff you just said I want that
