- Oh.
- No, honey, don't get up.
- What do you need?
- Uh, no, um, nothing.
Come on, I am here
to take care of you.
What do you need? Anything.
Okay. I have a wedgie.
Okay, that is all you.
(Phoebe)
So..
...so what do you want
for lunch?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess we have to eat.
Yeah, I do.
I'm..
What's the matter?
I'm just bummed the way
I left things with Ross.
Wish I didn't lie to him
about having to work.
Seems so mad at me.
Oh, yeah, don't be so hard
on yourself.
If someone I was still 
in love with was 
getting married
Still in love with?
Yeah.
I'm not in love with Ross.
Oh.
No, no. Good.
Yeah, me neither.
Phoebe, I'm not going to 
Ross's wedding 
because he's my ex-boyfriend
and that would be
really uncomfortable.
Not because I'm still
in love with him.
I mean, hey, you know, I like
Ross as much as the next guy.
You know, clearly,Â 
I have feelings for him
but feelings don't mean love.
You know, I mean, I still
have loving feelings for Ross?
You know..
...yeah!
But I have, I have 
continuing feelings of love
but that doesn't mean that
I'm still in love with him.
You know, I mean, I hav,
I have sexual feelings for him.
but I do love him.
[gasps]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my...why didn't
you tell me?
W-we thought you knew.
- "We?"
- Yeah, we all know.
We talk about it all the time.
You all know?
Does Ross know?
Oh, no. Ross doesn't 
know anything.
Oh, I cannot believe
you didn't tell me!
Well, 'cause
we thought you knew.
It's so obvious.
God, it-it would be like,
you know, telling Monica
"Hey, you know,
you like things clean."
