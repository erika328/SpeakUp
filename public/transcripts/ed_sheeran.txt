I was a very, very, very weird child.
Very weird child.
And I had a port wine
stain birthmark on my face
where I got lasered off
when I was very young.
And one day, they forgot
to put the anesthetic on
and then ever since then, I had a stutter.
And I also had very, very
big blue NHS glasses.
And the thing that I found
most difficult about it
was knowing what to say
but not really being
able to express it in the right way.
So I did different speech
therapies and stuff
which wasn't very successful.
At a young age, I got
very, very into rap music.
My dad bought me the Marshall Mathers LP
when I was nine years old,
not knowing what was on it
and let me listen to it.
And I learned every word
of it back to front.
It helped me get rid of the stutter.
Stuttering is not a thing you
have to worry about at all.
And even if you have quirks and weirdness,
you shouldn't be worried about that.
Just be yourself 'cause
there's no one in the world
that can be a better you than you.
And if you try to be
the cool kid from class,
you'll end up being very boring.
Be yourself; embrace your quirks.
Being weird is a wonderful thing.
Don't ever treat it as an
issue, and don't see it
as a plight on your life.
And carry on pushing forward.
And I did alright; you
can do alright as well.
Thank you.
