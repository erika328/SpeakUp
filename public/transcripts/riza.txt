They say that
happiness is pretty simple.
Someone to love, something to do,
something to look forward to.
I just wish they had been more specific.
Anyways.
Hey.
My name's Kariza,
I'm a twenty-something-year-old
Filipino girl from Canada.
I heard that writing helps
with stress and anxiety,
and, well, between the
world ending every week
and a quarter life crisis,
I need all the help I can get.
It's been hard, the past few months.
I felt like I couldn't do anything at all,
or, well, maybe I just
didn't know where to start.
I think before all this,
I was very preoccupied
with the business of every day things.
And since then, I've had a
lot of time to think about...
...you know, the meaning of it all.
More often than not, I took
things for what they were.
So busy just trying to survive, I guess.
But when you take away all
of life's distractions,
you're left faced with the
question we avidly avoid:
"What am I really doing here?"
Sometimes, I feel like
everyone has it down pat,
and I'm still trying to figure it out.
- [Robin Williams] Beauty, romance, love--
- [Kariza] They have it so easy.
- These are what we stay alive for.
- [Kariza] We watch movies
and hope that life is as fluid
and calculated as it is on screen,
either this or that,
with a clear outcome of
each decision they make.
It's like looking into a mirror
and seeing how you'd
want everything to be.
And we hear things that
hit our heartstrings
and watch stories with pieces of us in it.
And we look at it as a guide to life
when, really, it's just
an altered version of it.
(speaking in foreign language)
The loneliness.
The heartbreak.
The mess.
The freedom.
We all want an example,
a one-size-fits-all handbook
to help us navigate through.
But we can't just wait around
for life to happen to us...
We have to seek it.
We have these expectations
from movies and books,
and we try to look for answers in them.
But ultimately,
the only way to get through
this thing we call life
is to actively participate in it.
But you know,
I like the notion that everyone
has to live for themselves,
and not wait around for someone
to tell them who they are.
We can sit around and feel bad
and blame other people for
what they did or didn't do,
or blame ourselves for
things we've never told them.
But in the end, life
doesn't stop for anybody.
- You are here.
That life exists, and identity.
That the powerful play goes on,
and you may contribute a verse.
- [Kariza] You have to do things.
You have to take risks.
It's the only way to find
out who we really are,
and what we wanna do with
our time on this earth.
And even if we fail,
what better way is there to live?
