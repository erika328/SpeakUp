hi I'm Jenny my day starts early
well I'm a morning person I wake up at 5:00 a.m.
and take a moment to meditate
meditation helps me start the day with a
calm mind then I go the bathroom brush
my teeth and take a shower after that I
get dressed in my favorite clothes
preferring to wear something comfortable
then I go to the dining room to have
breakfast when I get there I always find
my mom preparing breakfast for us in the
kitchen my parents and I have breakfast
together with fresh orange juice as my
favorite drink after breakfast I check
my timetable and get ready for school at
school we have different classes like
science math and history history is my
favorite subject because it helped me
learn about past and understand how
things have changed over time we have a
five periods of History a week at
lunchtime I eat with my friends at the
school's cafeteria
we talk and laugh
sometimes we share our food
in the afternoon I continue with my classes
when school is over I go home 
once I arrive if teachers have given us
homework I do it first as I want to
finish early 
dinner is at 7:00 p.m. 
mom always surprises dad and me with a
dessert at dinner
my favorite dessert is cheesecake
after dinner I relax for a bit
either reading book or listening
music and I take a bath
brush teeth and wear pajamas and I get
ready to go bed I usually go to bed
early around 9:00 p.m.
however I sometimes stay up late on
weekends to watch my favorite movies
