i used to be one of those people who had
the disease to please
i said yes many times when i knew i
should have been saying no and then i
would be mad at myself for saying
yes you say yes
then you mad when they come back again
because when you say yes when you really
mean no
people
follow the intention of the yes
because why do you say yes
you say yes because you don't want the
person to be upset with you
they're not
you don't want the person to be angry
you want the person to think you're nice
they do
and that is why they keep coming back
nothing is showing up in your life that
you didn't order there
if it's there
it's there
because you needed to see it
so how do you set
boundaries for yourself i was having
trouble setting boundaries myself for
myself for even stranger so what i
learned was is that the reason why
people keep showing up is because my
intention is to make them think that i'm
such a nice person
that
you can ask me for anything
you can get me to do anything i'm going
to say yes i'm going to say yes so many
times you will have angst and worry
about things
and
you will put yourself in a state when
the other person really isn't even
thinking about you so
learning that i could specifically
determine for myself what the boundaries
were for me
what i wanted to do
give my money give my time give of my
service to who i wanted to give it to
when i did that i get to make that
decision and just because you get a
hundred requests a week doesn't mean you
have to try to fulfill all of that just
because you have all of these demands on
your time and on you doesn't mean that
you have to say yes you get to decide
because you're the master of your fate
the captain of your soul and
understanding that
really changed the meaning of my life in
that i was not
no longer driven by what
other people wanted me to do
but took charge of my own destiny making
choices based upon what do i feel
is the next right move for me
