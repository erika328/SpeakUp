stay focused
don't talk about what you're gonna do
don't just dream about what you're gonna
do don't criticize somebody else for
what they're not doing you be it be
about it be about that action and go do
it keep your eye on your intention
don't let any outside distraction or
your own insecurity stop you from your
goals
put in that work
there may be more failures than
victories yes i've been blessed to have
24 grammys but i've lost
46 times please don't ever feel entitled
to win just keep working harder
surrender to the cards you are dealt
it's from that surrender that you get
your power
losing can be the best motivator to get
you even bigger wins so never compare
yourself to anyone else
there will be wins and losses there will
be tears and laughter you'll feel the
shades of life deeply now with success
comes challenges
with your wins you may start to notice
people spending a lot of energy trying
to tear you down
try not to take it personally
unfortunately it's something that comes
along with success
embrace that struggle surviving that
struggle will strengthen you from your
goals
know that you're about to make the world
turn
i see you
you are everything the world needs you
