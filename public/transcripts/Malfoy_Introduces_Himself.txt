It's true then? What they're saying on
the train. Harry Potter has come to
Hogwarts. This is Crabbe and Goyle
and I'm Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.
Think my name is funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair and a hand-me-down robe...
you must be a Weasley. You'll soon find
out that some wizarding families are
better than others, Potter. You don't want
to go making friends with the wrong sort.
I can help you there. I think I can tell
the wrong sort for myself, thanks.
