Make it move!
Mooove!
Move!
He's asleep!
He's boring.
Sorry about him.
He doesn't understand what it's like, 
lying there day after day
watching people press their ugly faces in on you.
Can you hear me?
It's just...
I've never talked to a snake before...
Do you...
...I mean...
Do you talk to people often?
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?
Do you miss your family?
I see...
That's me as well, 
I never knew my parents either.
Mummy! Dad! Come here!
You won't believe what this snake is doing!
Thankssss
Anytime!
Snake!
Mum! Mummy!
My darling boy!
