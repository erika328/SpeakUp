You've tried the chicken factory?
I'm still having nightmares about those giblets.
We've tried beautician?
Turns out hot wax is not my friend
I'm running out of options for you Louisa.
Please I'll take anything.
Well this is new...care and companionship for a disabled man
Do you have any experience with caregiving?
Um I've never done it but I'm sure I could learn
Then lets go meet Will
Will, this is Louisa Clark.
Nathan will talk you through Will's routines and equipment
You don't have to talk across me mother. My brain isn't paralyzed...yet.
Good morning!
Urgh... he hates me
Everytime I speak he looks at me like I'm stupid
Well, to be fair, you are pretty stupid.
Yeah, but he doesn't know that yet.
Interesting choice of footwear.
What do you mean by that?
Well, they can't be from around here.
Why not?
This is the kind of place people come to when they've got tired of actually living
I'm happy here
Well, you shouldn't be. You only get one life. Its actually your duty to live it as fully as possible
No, stay
Tell me something good
When I was little, my favourite outfit was my bumblebee tights
Bumblebee tights?
Black and yellow stripes
Oh dear god
Didn't you ever love anything that much?
Yes
Please don't tell me you shaved off my eyebrows
Only the one
Can I take you somewhere?
You are so going on a date with Will Trainer
It's too booby
Get the red dress out
I don't want to go in yet. I just want to be a man who's been to a concert with a girl in a red dress, a few minutes more
I promised my parents 6 months and thats what I've given them
But that was before
Me
I want him to live but only if he wants to live
I can't just let this happen
You can't change who people are
Then what can you do?
You love them
I don't want you to miss all the things that someone else could give you
But I can make you happy
I have become a whole new person because of you
Do you know something Clark?
You are pretty much the only thing that makes me wanna get up in the morning
