if you want something you've never had
before you must do something you've
never done before it's taken me years of
tragedy of losing myself inside only to
realize what I must have always known
that you can be anything you
dream
dream dream until your dreams come true
act on your passion and when your shot
comes take it look fear in the face and
embrace it the time is now the moment is
now believe in yourself like I believe
this to be true the world needs more of
you
