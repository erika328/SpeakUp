Hi, I'm George from Pact Coffee and 
today I'm going to teach you how to  
brew a flat white using an espresso machine.
First of all prepare your coffee shot. 
You're going to take your portafilter  
and you're going to get 19 grams 
of coffee ground fine for espresso.
Now many flat white recipes 
will use a double ristretto  
but today we're going to use a double espresso.
Level the coffee with your hands, remove 
any coffee from the edges of the basket
and then tamp the coffee puck into place.
Nice firm pressure but the most important 
thing is a really nice and even coffee bed.
Before you put your portafilter in place you want  
to purge any steam that's built 
up in the head of your machine
and then go ahead and add your 
portafilter to the espresso machine.
Now you're going to take your cup and remember 
for a flat white we're going to use a nice  
small 6oz cup. Going to pop that in place
and we're going to start 
brewing our espresso shot.
The key things to look out for are a really nice 
dark colour and a syrupy texture at the start  
and an extraction time of 26-30 seconds.
The yield, so the grams in the cup of liquid 
is double the amount of coffee in the dose,  
so a 19 gram dose of coffee 
is a 38 gram yield in the cup.
Now it's time to steam our milk.
So, always use a full-fat dairy milk or a barista 
version of an oat milk or another alternative.
You're going to fill the milk 
jug to half way, up to the spout.
You're going to put the milk jug into place 
with the steam wand in the centre of the jug  
and then you're going to tilt the jug to 
one side. This is going to allow you to  
create that whirlpool which gives you 
that lovely, silky micro-foam texture
and what you're going to listen for is that 
subtle hissing sound, not a load screaming  
noise. Just a subtle hiss for a few seconds and 
then you can put the wand deeper into the milk.
Okay, once that milk is really hot to the touch,  
yep, we're going to stop 
steaming the milk just there.
Make sure you clean that steam wand, get rid 
of any milk residues, first thing you do.
You want to remove any large bubbles by 
giving it a good, firm tap on your surface
and swirl the milk and mix it all together. The  
texture you're looking for is a really 
nice glossy sheen, a bit like paint.
Okay, time to pour. This is the tricky part but 
with practice, you're going to nail it, i'm sure!
So take your coffee, take your milk, 
start by pouring nice and carefully.  
Fill the cup about three 
quarters full, loads of control.
Take a pause. Now bring your spout 
really close to the surface and just  
manipulate that foam really nicely to 
create that lovely latte art texture.
There you have it, that's how 
you make a perfect flat white.
Thanks for watching this 
Pact Coffee tutorial. Enjoy.
