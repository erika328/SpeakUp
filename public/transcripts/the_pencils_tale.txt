Once Upon a Time an old pencil maker
took his newest Pencil aside just before
he was about to pack him into a box
Imagining the little fellow was a person
he recalled a few things about the
pencil
there are five things you need to know
he said to his pencil
before I send you out into the world
always remember these five things never
forget them
and you will become the best pencil you
can be
the first thing is to remember that you
will be able to do many great things but
only if you put yourself in someone
else's hands
from time to time you will experience a
painful sharpening but remember that
this will make you a better pencil
also keep in mind that you will be able
to correct any mistakes you might make
along the way
the most important part of you is what's
on the inside
and remember this as well
upon every surface that you are used you
must leave your mark
no matter what else happens you must
continue to write
it seemed the pencil listened to him and
promised he would remember these five
things
so that he could live his life with
heart and purpose
you see in life in your life put
yourself in someone else's hand
Embrace challenges for growth
learn from mistakes
value inner qualities
and leave a positive mark on the world
and you too
can become the best pencil there is
this was the pencil's tale and this is
there to do motivation thank you so much
for watching and stay blessed
