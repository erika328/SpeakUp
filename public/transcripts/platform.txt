What are you looking at? Blimey, is that the time?
Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...well he'll be
wanting to see me. Now your train leaves
in 10 minutes. There's your ticket. Stick
to it, Harry, that's very important. Stick to
your ticket.
But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This
says Platform 9 and 3/4. There's no such
thing is there?
Excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform
9 and 3/4? 9 and 3/4? Think you're being
funny do you?
Muggles?
Platform 9 and 3/4 this way.
Alright, Percy, you first.
Fred, you next.
He's not Fred, I am!
Honestly, woman. You call yourself our mother.
Oh, I'm sorry George.
I'm only joking, I am Fred!
Excuse me! Could you tell me how to... How to get onto the platform? Yes,
not to worry dear, it's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well. Now all you've got
to do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a
bit of a run if you're nervous.
Good luck.
