Attention to detail in the preparation
is the prerequisite of all planning.
Ah! Harry, my boy. I was beginning to worry.
You brought someone with us, I see.
Ron Weasley, sir.
But I'm dead awful at Potions. A menace, actually so. I'm probably just gonna -
Nonsense! We'll sort you out. Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.
Sorry sir, I haven't actually got my book yet. And nor has Ron.
Don't worry, get what you want from the cupboard.
Now, as I was saying. I prepared some concoctions this morning.
Any ideas what these might be?
Yes, miss...?
Granger, sir.
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.
And that one -
it's terribly tricky to make.
This is Amortentia. The most powerful love potion in the world.
It's rumoured to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.
For example, I smell...
freshly mown grass and...
new parchment and...
spearmint toothpaste.
Now, Amortentia doesn't create actual love.
That would be impossible. But it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession.
And for that reason,
it is probably the most dangerous potion
in this room.
Sir? You haven't told us what's in that one.
Ah, yes.
What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen...
is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.
It is more commonly referred to as -
Liquid Luck.
Yes, miss Granger.
Liquid Luck.
Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong.
One sip and you will find that all of your endeavours succeed.
At least, until the effects wear off.
So, this is what I offer each of you today.
One tiny vial of Liquid Luck
to the student who in the hour that remains,
manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death.
Recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books.
I should point out, however,
only one student who manages to brew a a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.
Let the brewing commence.
How did you do that?
Crush it, don't cut it.
No, the instructions specifically say to cut.
No, really.
Merlin's beard! It is perfect!
So perfect I dare say one drop would kill us all!
So here we are then, as promised. One vial of Felix Felicis.
Congratulations.
Use it well.
