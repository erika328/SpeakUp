do not waste your time desiring what
other people have
remember the things that you now have
are things you once only hoped for
so i live in that space every day
of practicing gratitude
because i know that being grateful
wherever you are
whatever place or space in your life
being grateful changes your personal
vibration i was just having a
conversation with cheryl sandberg the
other day about her book option b
and we all know she lost her beloved
husband david and i said how
did you get through it and she said by
practicing gratitude i didn't believe it
at first but i started to write down
three things every day that i was
grateful for i said oh i've been doing
that for years
because
when you wake up in the morning
looking at the world
for what you're going to write down or
what you're going to state to yourself
by the end of the day that you're
grateful for you have a different
outlook on life
i'm just waiting on somebody to hold the
door see if that makes the list
some days you only have
i'm still breathing
