Hi, I'm Benedict Cumberbatch
and I'm here at BuzzFeed
and I'm here to play with puppies
and to answer your questions.
I'm excited, I'm excited to meet the pups.
Bring in the pups.
(upbeat music)
Hello, you're a big puppy.
What are we doing in here?
What a strange environment to be in.
(toys squeaking)
What was that noise?
What was that noise?
What's in the jar, what's in
the jar, what's in the jar?
What's this, what's this?
What's this, it's a question.
"What's the best and worst thing
"about playing Doctor Strange?"
The best thing is, yeah,
you eat that question,
eat it up, yeah, yeah.
There's a lot of best things about it.
The best thing is probably having
a cloak that means I can fly,
which means I get to do wire work,
which, when it's done
right, and not for too long,
in a harness is incredibly good fun.
Some of the stunts are
really good fun to do.
The training and all of
that, I really enjoy.
It's a big old work out.
Yes, it is!
The worst thing is, I don't know,
it's a really gifted gig, I'm very lucky.
If I had to moan about
something, what would it be?
Maybe the cloak, again, the
cloak is quite cumbersome.
No pun intended, hello.
Yeah, it can be quite a sort
of awkward thing to work with.
Cookie jar, no, I'm joking,
it's questions, I'm so sorry.
"Do you still know how to play the violin?
"If so, what's," do I still know?
I never knew how to play
the violin, next question.
It was all fakery and really embarrassing.
You know, this is something
that takes years of practices
from the age of three
and then I'm supposed to
sort of turn it around
in a couple of months
before doing a bit of Sherlock.
Not good, my friends.
I can pretend to be a lot of things
with some degree of authenticity
but that is something well beyond me.
"If there was season five of 'Sherlock,'
"what would you want to
happen to your character?"
Next question.
"Who's the first real
friend you made in Hollywood
"and do you two still speak?"
I don't know, I mean,
Gary Oldman, I guess?
Yeah, we still speak.
First time I went to
Hollywood, I did "Star Trek"
and I don't speak to them nearly,
I mean, Zoe, I see more of, obviously,
because of the Marvel thing,
but Chris, I adore, and,
you know, and Zachary as well.
Yeah, it is a great family.
It was a great family to be a part of
for a little while there.
And darling Anton, as well,
who I wish I could still
speak to, very sad.
Don't eat my questions
before I've read them.
It's like having naked flames in the room,
this is wonderful.
"How hard was it to jump
back into your normal life
"after playing a role
like Patrick Melrose?"
Good question.
Difficult, I abstracted
myself from my normal life
for a little while, especially
when I went to the dark zone
of cocaine and heroin abuse
and trashing hotel rooms
in the New York episode.
Just didn't really want to go home
with any of that swirling
around my brain and body.
I mean, not literally,
but just psychically
and physically, because
you just have to pretend
and put yourself there
and you need some space.
But most of the time, I switch
on and off pretty easily.
"Which app on your phone
do you use the most?"
Probably Waze.
Hey, go easy, you may be bigger,
but that's not playing
fair, stop it, stop it.
Yeah, pick on someone your own size.
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
"If you could do a film adaptation
"of any TV show you loved as a child,
"which one would it be?"
Why would I want to do a film of
something that worked well
in its time as a TV series?
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I get that happens a lot,
but that's not really, that's not my gig.
I'm not too fond of that stuff.
"Are you ever going to
join Instagram or Twitter?"
De nada, no, absolutely not.
"Who are your all-time favorite musicians?
"Which present artists are
you listening to nowadays?"
I don't have an all-time favorite.
I mean, Bowie, The Stones, The Ramones,
Sex Pistols, Clash, Who, Pink Floyd.
What am I listening to at the moment?
Well, there's a new album, it's great,
A Moon Shaped Pool gets
a lot of play, Radiohead,
I love Tom's new album as well,
it's a very good film he did
with Paul Thomas Anderson.
I'm being so serious whilst
your relative chews my boot.
You want to chew my boot?
Do you want to chew my boot?
"Describe your perfect day," hello.
This is a perfect day, isn't it?
Getting my ear licked by a puppy.
Yeah, this is pretty
perfect, this is great,
but I mean, the rest of perfect with me
would be private, so
I won't describe that.
Work-wise, though, a perfect day is,
I don't know, I love my job,
pretty much every day is a good one.
A perfect day's when I've
had eight hours sleep.
That's a perfect day.
"What are some of your pet peeves?"
Oh, god, but people sound so grouchy
when they answer these
questions, I don't know.
People leaning on the horn
thinking it's gonna make
traffic move faster.
People being trapped in
their bubble, you know.
People being trapped in
their bubble full stop.
Mobile phone usage.
Negative impact of some of social media.
I mean, I could go on.
I'm an old fogy now, 43, sufficient.
Good question, I really could go on.
So I will.
Dirty tricks, demagoguery,
fake news, everyone's
a critic and angry but
they don't necessarily
have any kind of nuance,
they just want to shoot
the messenger sometimes
and not the message.
The fact that we're in a crisis people,
a climate crisis, these little puppy dogs.
Save the puppies if not yourselves.
Stop using single-use plastic.
Try and stop digging carbon
fuels out of the ground.
Please, leave the fossil
fuels alone for these puppies.
That's a dangerous question to give me.
Yeah, can I have another pet peeve,
yeah, burning rainforests,
what the (bleeps) is wrong with the world?
"What was it like babysitting Tom Holland
"during your MCU press tour?"
Difficult, like I said, I had
to teach the kid how to shave,
how to brush his teeth, the
fact that he had to do it
both day and night.
You know, personal hygiene's
a bit of an issue with teenagers
and Tom's no exception to that rule.
So, you know, I'd get the rooms,
I'd get out the, it was tricky.
But, you know, he's, in all honesty,
he's a gentleman, brilliant,
wise beyond his years,
A dear friend, I love working with him
and bring on the next project, goodbye.
Thanks so much!
I'm Benedict Cumberbatch, watch my movie,
it's called "The Current War,"
it's not mine, it belongs
to other people, too.
It's really good.
North Shore Animal League America,
thank you, puppies, and thank
you for looking after them.
They're very sweet.
Bye-bye.
