Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid.
Exactly what is that?
That Ron, is a Hippogriff.
First thing you want to know about Hippogriff's is that they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a Hippogriff.
It may just be the last thing you ever do.
Now. Who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done Harry. Well done.
Come on now.
Now, you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite. So, step up. Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not, well, we'll get to that later.
Make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry. Back off.
[twig snaps]
Keep still.
Keep still.
Oh! Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute.
Right. I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on. Don't be shy.
Nice and slow now.
Nice and slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slow now.
Slowly.
Yes!
Well done! Oh, well done, Harry! Well done!
I think he may let you ride him now.
What?
Come on.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hagrid!
Don't pull out any of his feathers
because he won't thank you for that.
Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
[whistles]
Well done, Harry!
And well done, Buckbeak!
