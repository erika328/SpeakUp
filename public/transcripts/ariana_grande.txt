sometimes people can sensationalize
things and um assign
meaning to certain things and we do a
lot of like boiling things down we do a
lot of like stripping of humanness and
Erasure of context and I think that
every moment of Our Lives contains
multitudes of of feelings of thoughts of
good and bad
[Music]
and um you kind of crave when you grow
up the happily ever after you can't kind
of stomach anything that's inauthentic
anymore and you just have to say
gracefully and respectfully we need to
make some
changes I think growing up kind of you
want what you don't have like you um you
cling on to that fairy tale you kind of
self
abandon and um a massive thing that I
learned my
fears of replicating a certain
cycle was actually the opposite and I
also think that if I'm not doing
something
that makes me nervous or scared or
feel that anticipatory
excitement in a positive way you know
feeling those nerves in a positive way
then maybe it's not elevating my art
maybe it's not there yet maybe it's not
good enough so I think I I think it's a
healthy feeling it means doing the right
thing it means listening to
your
[Music]
soul I want to have the strength to say
bye kindly when something isn't right
it's as simple as that and kind of
look forward with hope and awareness and
just looking to something bigger than us
to kind of help us make sense of it
[Music]
