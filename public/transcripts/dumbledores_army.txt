You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.
The what?
It's also known as the Come and Go Room.
The Room of Requirement only appears when
a person has real need of it, and is always
equipped for the seeker's needs.
So, say you really needed the toilet...
Charming, Ronald. But yes, that is the general
idea.
It's brilliant.
It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
Expelliarmus!
I'm hopeless.
You're just flourishing your wand too much,
try it like this.
Expelliarmus!
You will please copy the approved text four
times to ensure maximum retention.
There will be no need to talk.
No need to think, is more like it.
Expelliarmus.
Wands away!
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.
It's sort of a wizard's bread and butter,
really.
So um, come on then Nigel!
Give me your best shot.
Stupefy!
Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.
Don't worry, I'll go easy on you.
Thanks, Ronald.
Come on, Ron.
Come on, Ron!
One sickle.
You're on.
Stupefy!
Thank you.
Shut up.
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?
It's completely intentional.
Up you come.
Do you like a cup of tea?
Now focus on a fixed point and try again.
Expelliarmus!
Very good, keep your concentration.
Great, a little higher.
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Stupefy!

Working hard is important.
But there's something that matters even more,
believing in yourself.
Think of it this way, every great wizard in
history started out as nothing more than what
we are now - students.
If they could do it, why not us?
Reducto!
Expelliarmus!
Fantastic, Neville.
Well done.
So, that's it for this lesson.
Now, we're not going to be meeting again until
after the holidays, so just keep practicing
on your own as best you can.
And well done, everyone, great work!
Well done, mate.
Thanks.
