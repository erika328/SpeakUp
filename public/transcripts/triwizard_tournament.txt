Clear the runway!
Well, there's something you don't see every day.
Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd
like to make an announcement.
This castle will not only be your
home this year, but home to some very
special guests as well. You see, Hogwarts has been chosen... [muttering]
So, Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event, the Triwizard
Tournament. Now for those of you do not
know the Triwizard Tournament brings
together three schools for a series of
magical contests. For each school a
single student is selected to compete.
Let me be clear, if chosen you stand
alone. And trust me when I say these
contests are not for the faint-hearted.
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming the
lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy
of Magic and their headmistress Madame Maxime!
Bloody hell!
Blimey, that's one big woman.
And now our friends from the north.
Please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang
and their headmaster Igor Karkaroff.
Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!
Albus!
Igor.
