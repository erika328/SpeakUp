hey Monica
have you seen Rachel or a mirror 
this for my vote pretty cool huh it's great
Oh what's the matter talk to the captain
just having one of those days where you
realize you're in a dead-end
relationship Sandler giving you a hard
time huh it's not like I want to get
married tomorrow
it's just I'd like to believe that I'm
in a relationship that's going somewhere
that I'm not just wasting my time oh you
know Chandler oh I don't know Chandler
not anymore it's like it's like
something's changed maybe you changed I
didn't change maybe that's the problem
What?
Chandler is a complex fellow one who was
unlikely to take a wife what does he
think does he think I'm just gonna wait
around for nothing like a Chandler is
against marriage and it always will be
yeah well there's some people who do
want to marry me there are yeah Richard
Richard said he wants to marry you and
and Chandler's telling you how much he
hates marriage that's right 
Chandler loves marriage
you just told me that he hates marriage
that that he's a a complex fellow who's
unlikely to take a wife that he's
against marriage and always will be you
got that from what I said
