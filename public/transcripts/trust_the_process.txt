I think that we in some strange way are
conditioned to believe that success
comes overnight that success is
microwavable that success can go into an
air fryer and it can come right out in
some strange
way we are convinced that if in fact the
journey is too hard or that the journey
takes too long or that the hurdles are
too frequent or that the mountain is Too
Tall that maybe this means that this is
not for us maybe this means means that
this isn't supposed to happen for me
maybe this means that I'm in the wrong
space when in fact is quite the
opposite I think you're actually right
on the road you're supposed to be when
it's
hard when something's easy it sounds
like it's not supposed to be yours often
times we want the Finish Line without
running the race you have something that
you're going
for and just because it's hard doesn't
mean that it's not meant for you it
doesn't mean that this isn't supposed to
happen it just means that you are in the
middle of a
process and you have to stay on that
process people ask me all the time Des
sh why' you keep going why' you keep
going why' you keep going it's because I
understood that this is a
process and that if it was easy
everybody would achieve
it the reason why it's easier for me to
be able to stay on the road to success
whether it is through missUSA whether it
is through 11 years in the military
whether it is through a master's degree
whether it is through the seven years it
took for me to become a notable speaker
whether it is to be an author or a
nonprofit
CEO I understand the process and I
understand the road and I understand
that this isn't meant to be easy
therefore it is so much easier for me to
climb this mountain because I understand
the terrain that I'm about to
experience each and every one of you
need to understand the road that you're
on and the terrain you're going to
experience it makes it easier for you to
be able to handle it if you walk into
something thinking that it's supposed to
be easy then you're wondering why it's
hard and then that's why you're ready to
give
up I have two challenges in this part of
perseverance
one I challenge you to accept this road
for what it truly is and get rid of the
fairy tales get rid of whatever is
telling you is supposed to be
easy and then I challenge you to never
let a failure go to
waste what do I mean by
that every single time I went back to
theate competition I learned more and
more about myself that by the end of
that seven-year period I became a more
elevated version of the
shaa by the time I got to the missusa
stage I had learned everything that I
needed to learn to be able to handle a
national
title every single year Des got
better after about 3 years I realized
Des this wig isn't going to
work it's not going to work de you got
to let it go y'all saw the wig we don't
have to spend too much time on it but
there was a
wig and I kept wearing
it but after three years I got it okay
the girls know I got I got the the
bundles in after a while we got it
together
right what I'm saying is that every
single time you run into a hurdle every
single time you run into a loss every
single time you run into a fail
I want you to take that lesson home with
you and then the next day I want you to
show up better
