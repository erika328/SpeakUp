ladies and gentlemen our first lesson of
the day don't talk do
don't explain work
don't defend accomplish
don't expect show
the truth is at every corner you turn
someone will be doubting you in almost
always based on what you look like where
you're from the assumptions they have in
their head the stereotypes they carry in
their heart it's unfortunate but it's
true
I no longer try to prove myself to
anyone or anybody
there is only one person I seek
validation from and that is the woman I
see in the mirror every day
her and her only that I care about her
opinion her perspective her feelings
that's it I don't try to prove myself I
don't try to prove anything my resume
speaks for itself yes these your resumes
speak for themselves your work speaks
for itself who you are the great work
you do speaks for itself
I challenge each of you to be the judge
and the jury over the validity of your
work over the validity of your
aspirations over the validity of your
accomplishments the validity of your
value and your life and most importantly
I want you to be the judge and the jury
over the validity of where you belong
along where you decide you belong you
deserve what you decide you deserve I
always say the universe only honors what
you believe you deserve belief is a
powerful weapon and we need more of it
your first lesson today is don't talk do
say it with me don't talk dude one more
time don't talk dude all right now
listen two round of applause though for
number one
