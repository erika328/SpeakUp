When I was a kid, this used to be my favourite place in the whole world.
I think this would still be my favourite spot.
That's because you haven't been anywhere.
Ah, so where is better than this then?
Paris...
"Place Dauphine" right by the "Pont Neuf".
If I shut my eyes now, I know exactly how it feels to be in that little square
So let's go, we could get on a Eurostar right now!
You don't get it Clarke, I wanna be in Paris as me.
The old me...
♫ 'There she goes in front of me.' ♫
Tell me something good.
Use the time he has got left, show him how good his life can be.
Will has barely left the house in 2 years, we have tried.
Yes, but we haven't succeeded.
Will needs to be allowed to feel like a man.
Can I take you somewhere?
Hahaha, you are so going on a date with Will Traynor.
It's too booby.
Get the red dress out.
♫ 'We will make memory out of it.' ♫
Lose the scarf, if you're gonna wear a dress like that Clarke, you'll have to wear it with confidence.
Only you Will Traynor will tell a woman how to wear a bloody dress.
'On June 3rd'
Move closer, you smell fantastic.
You know you never would have let those breast so near to me if I wasn't in a wheelchair.
Hahaha, yeah well you never would have been looking at these breast if you hadn't been in a wheelchair.
Uh what?! ofcourse I would.
No you wouldn't, you would have been to busy looking at the leggy blonds.
The ones you can smell a expansive gown of forty bases, and anyway I would have been over there serving the drinks, one of the invisibles.
Am I right?
Yes, but in my defense I was an ass.
hahahaha, yup.
Do you know something Clarke?
You are pretty much the only thing that makes me want to get up in the morning.
Then let's go somewhere.
Anywhere in the world, just you and me.
What do you say?
Say yes Will.
Go on.
Okay.
'Live boldly.'
♫ 'It's gonna get easier, easier,  some how.' ♫
I can't
You can, you can do anything.
Wooo aahh.
'Live well.'
♫ 'Easier, easier somehow'
'Just live.'
I don't want you to miss all the things someone else could give you.
I have become a whole new person because of you.
♫ 'Easier and easier some how...' ♫
