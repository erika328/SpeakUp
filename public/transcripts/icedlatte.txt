My name is Mike Jones, and I'm a barista at
Third Rail Coffee right by Washington Square
Park in New York City.
I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making
skills.
I am going to show you how to make an Iced
Latte.
This is really simple as long as you have
a few good shots of espresso.
You have a glass of cold milk.
And you pour the shot over that.
Once it's finished, add some ice and there
you go.
So, I am going to get that espresso right
in.
Right, the espresso looks good.
Just pour it over the milk.
Either stir or swirl it around to incorporate
it.
Add the ice.
Now, that's an Iced Latte.
And, you can pour this into as much or as
little amount of milk as you'd like.
I like them short.
So, it looks perfect.
