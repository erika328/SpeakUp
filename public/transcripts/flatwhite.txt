My favourite cup of coffee at the moment
is a Flat White and I'm going to show
you how to make the perfect CRU Flat
White. First thing you need to think about
is water. Great water in, equals a great
cup of coffee and if you think about
those really cool speciality coffee
shops out there, they've usually got two
filtration systems on their water to
make sure they get in great water, so use
mineral water, drop that in at the back. A Flat White is less milk and more coffee
that's why it tastes so delicious.
So think about the cup that you're using
for this one I only need one shot but
for this one it's bigger so I put two
shots in that. The next thing you've got
to think about is warming your coffee
cup especially in the morning it makes
all the difference. If you put beautiful
hot coffee into a cold cup, it just kind of
dulls it, you lose a bit of its
personality so warm your cup - just a
little bit of hot water in there to heat
it up. Okay so now your cups warm let's
grab some CRU coffee and drop it in.
Now don't press the coffee,
let's froth the milk first and then we
do the coffee, that way everything is hot.
And fill it about a third full, place the
milk into the frothing arm and what you
don't want to do is move it around too
much you want creamy milk for a Flat
White, not frothy milk so just turn it on
and let it slowly heat up. So that's
froth, take it out, and now what you need
to do is you need to give it a tap to
get rid of some of the air bubbles. Once
you've tapped the air bubbles out, set it
aside and hit your coffee button.
So the coffee's done,
the milks done. Perfect, now we're just
going to bring them together. And that's
how you make the perfect CRU Flat White.
