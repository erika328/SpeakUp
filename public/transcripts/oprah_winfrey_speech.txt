empowerment is authority it is a sign permission 
slip to actually seize the day it's the process  
of getting stronger and more confident and more 
engaged and to be empowered is to move through  
the world without any kind of fear or any kind 
of apology and with these gifts comes an even  
deeper privilege i believe and that is the ability 
to take charge of your own life to own yourself  
and claim your rights and here's what i know for 
sure that to whom much is given much is expected  
and i have been given so much i've earned it i've 
been blessed with it but i've been given a lot and  
that's why i've chosen to use my life to lift 
other people up nobody's journey is seamless or  
smooth we all stumble we all have setbacks if 
things go wrong you hit a dead end as you will  
it's just life's way of saying time to change 
course so ask every failure this is what i do  
every failure every crisis every difficult 
time i say what is this here to teach me  
and as soon as you get the 
lesson you get to move on  
if you really get the lesson you pass and you 
don't have to repeat the class if you don't  
get the lesson it shows up wearing another 
pair of pants to give you some remedial work
