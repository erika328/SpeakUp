Excuse me?
Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.
Not at all.
I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
So... so is it true?
I mean...
Do you really have the...
The what?
The scar?
Oh.
Wicked.
Anything off the trolley, dears?
No thanks. I'm all set.
We'll take the lot.
Whoa.
Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans?
They mean every flavour.
There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also...
spinach, liver and tripe.
George swore he got a bogey flavoured one once.
These aren't real frogs, are they?
It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want.
Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard.
I've got about 500 myself.
Watch it!
Ah, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.
I've got Dumbledore!
I've got about 6 of him.
Hey, he's gone!
Well you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?
This is Scabbers, by the way.
Pathetic isn't he?
Just a little bit.
Fred gave him a spell to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Yeah.
Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one.
No.
Oh! Are you doing magic? Let's see then.
Sunshine, daisies, butter, mellow,
turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?
Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself.
But they've all worked for me.
For example...
Oculus Reparo.
That's better, isn't it?
Holy cricket. You're Harry Potter!
I'm Hermione Granger.
And... you are?
Um... Ron Weasley.
Pleasure.
You two better change into your robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.
You've got dirt on your nose, by the way.
Did you know?
Just there.
