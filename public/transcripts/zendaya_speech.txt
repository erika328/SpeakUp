we are not playing okay
it is not a game with these Millennials
all right and we are here to stay
and we are going to change the game and
I think that that's so powerful right
game changer we are the future we are
the Future Leaders of the world we are
the ones who are going to make this
world a better place please understand
the power of your voice please
understand that you have the capacity to
literally change the world and I know
that's a lot of pressure and trust me I
feel it too sometimes you know I'll put
out a Instagram or whatever or I'll
speak out and do whatever and I get hit
with all kinds of things and you know
I'm like damn should I post that and I'm
like yes absolutely I should have
wow I just want to say first of all I
want to say thank you for having me out
you guys don't understand how important
the work that's being done here is
um I'm a little nervous because you know
this is something you know awards are
great but this is something that really
means something and it's something that
really means something to me
and
so
I'm gonna make it short I'm Gonna Make
It Sweet but you know
um I was talking to uh Osa actually I
just just done a little break here and
we were just talking about things and
she was saying you know thank you for
for what you do and I was just like are
you kidding me thank you for what you do
right I mean she was
um but something she said she said you
know it's rare that there's a place
where young people
um can speak and have voice and people
will actually listen
um and I think that that kind of
struck a chord with me because I am a
young person right and um I'm a young
person with a lot of followers and
um you know I always say that I would
much rather be known for
um the content of my character and the
kind of person that I am then the last
project that I did or the last movie
that I did or the last music that I put
out
and um
I think it's so important when what I've
learned and and being here tonight is so
special to me because I'm around
like-minded people and like-minded young
people you know what I'm saying like I'm
around my peers young people like both
of yourselves who are so courageous and
and so beautiful in your own way and are
not afraid
to be exactly who you are
and that is so
beautiful and so you know to know your
purpose and to know who you are at such
a young age is is hard and it's
difficult and I'm lucky to be around
people like this who have found that
um within themselves and continue to
live that truth every single day and
I've learned that like my purpose I
think
is I have this platform right I have
this platform that I'm standing on and
sometimes when you get there
you realize that your purpose is not to
stand on it anymore but to get off and
let somebody else stand on it
so
so that's what I want to continue to do
and continue to push and to every
student that's here I just want you to
know that I admire you you know what I
mean this this award is really for us
right because we are the game changers
we are the ones who are literally
changing the game
we we are not playing okay
it is not a game with these Millennials
all right and we are here to stay
and we are gonna change the game and I
think that that's so powerful right game
changer we're the ones who are going to
and I I say it over and over again and
it's overused but we are the future we
are the Future Leaders of the world we
are the ones who are going to make this
world a better place and I said it that
day and I'm gonna say it again but it's
so true please understand the power of
your voice please understand that you
have the capacity to literally change
the world and I know that's a lot of
pressure and trust me I feel it too
sometimes you know I'll put out a
Instagram or whatever or I'll speak out
and do whatever and I get hit with all
kinds of things and you know I'm like
damn should I post that and I'm like yes
absolutely I should have
thank you
absolutely I should have so do not let
other people's I guess you could say
insecurities
um and don't do not let that fear cause
fear and um and allow that to silence
you
allow never allow that fear to silence
you continue to be outspoken continue to
believe and live in your truth and do
exactly what you were meant to do and so
honestly I'm just here to say that I
appreciate you and I thank you and
everybody in this room for continuing to
not only cultivate those young minds but
say but give us a platform and a space
to speak and listen

so hard and sometimes you forget to just
kind of stop and um and take in moments
like this sometimes I was talking about
it earlier I feel like I work so much I
forget about life and to actually be
present in these kinds of moments where
you can look around the room amongst
people that you appreciate and and just
take it in you know and just and just be
happy and just be alive for a second so
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna just
like take a second look around and be
