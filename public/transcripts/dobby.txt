Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy!
I have something of yours.
Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, I think you do sir.
I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley.
You do, do you?
Why don't you prove it.
Come, Dobby.
Open it.
Dobby!
Master has given Dobby a sock!
What? I didn't gi...
Master has presented Dobby with clothes!
Dobby is free.
You lost me my servant!
You shall not harm Harry Potter! Avada...
Your parents were meddlesome fools too.
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon, you are going to meet the same, sticky end.
Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby
ever repay him?
Just promise me something.
Anything, sir.
Never try to save my life again.
