I hated that job, and
I clung to that job.
Ten years in a place without heat.
Six years in a job I felt stuck in.
Maybe I was afraid of change.
Are you?
When I was 29, I told myself,
the next acting job I get,
no matter what it pays,
I will from now on,
for better or worse, be a working actor.
And now I didn't have
neither the internet,
or a cell phone, or a job.
But something good happened.
I got a low paying theater job
in a played called Imperfect Love.
Which lead to a film called 13
Moons, with the same writer.
Which lead to other roles,
which lead to other roles.
And I worked as an actor ever since.
I didn't know that would happen.
At 29, walking away from data processing,
I was terrified.
But this made me very hungry.
Literally.
(laughing)
I couldn't be lazy.
Now I tell this story
because the world might say
you're not allowed to yet.
Please, don't even bother asking.
Don't bother telling
the world you are ready.
Show it.
Do it.
Trust me.
A rhythm sets in.
Just try not to wait, until like me,
you're 29 before you find it.
And if you are, that's fine too.
Some of us will never find it.
But you will.
I promise you.
Raise the rest of your life to meet you.
Don't search for the defining moments,
because they will never come.
The moments that define
you have already happened.
And they will already happen again.
Don't wait until they
tell you, you are ready.
Get in there.
I waited a long time out in the world
before I gave myself permission to fail.
What did Beckett say?,
"Ever tried.
Ever failed.
No matter.
Try again.
Fail again.
Fail better."
The world is yours.
Treat everyone kindly.
And light up the night.
