the reason why I'm standing on stage
today is because I turned my pain into
purpose and I decided I wanted to become
a motivational speaker to inspire each
and every one of you to not only chase
your dreams but to also not take
advantage of
time we don't have much of it and
neither do the individuals around
us and you can't use
success to hide you from the grief and
the sorrow that you will eventually face
when it comes to our tragedies the
moments in which life throws us a
curveball that we not
expecting it's understanding that we
have One Life to Live and the question
is if something were to happen to you
tomorrow would you be happy with how you
live
today I stand on stages like this
because I want to encourage you all to
remember that tomorrow is not
promised so I want you to make that
phone call I want you to give that hug I
want you to let go of that
Grudge I want you to choose peace I want
you to let go of your
anger and I want you to know that we
only have one shot at
this
one and that even in moments like this
in which let's say for the past few
years you haven't been doing right by
people or individuals around you or even
by yourself you can always try again as
long as there's air in your lungs you
can always do
better I don't want you to make the same
mistake that I made by spending too much
time focused on My Success focused on a
Crown focused on achievement that you
forget what's actually
important
Champions are also champions of their
families they're champions of their
mental and emotional health they are
champions of their goals and their
passions as well as their
businesses Champions pour into all
categories of their life and they don't
neglect themselves or the people around
them Champions are self-aware
and they understand when they need to
make change
