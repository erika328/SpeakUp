I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch programme.
We are going to train earlier, harder and longer.
What? I don't believe it.
Where do you think you're going, Flint?
Quidditch practice.
I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
Easy Wood, I've got a note.
Uh oh. I smell trouble.
I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to
practice today, owing to need to
train their new seeker.
You've got a new seeker? Who?
Malfoy?
That's right. And that's not all that's new this year.
Those are Nimbus 2001's. How did you get those?
A gift from Draco's father.
You see Weasley, unlike some, my father
can afford the best.
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.
No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.
You'll pay for that one Malfoy. Eat slugs!
Are you OK Ron?
Say something.
Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
No Colin. Get out of the way.
Let's take him to Hagrid's.
He'll know what to do.
