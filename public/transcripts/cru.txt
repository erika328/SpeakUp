so why is crude coffee
better coffee well it's really simple
the first thing we do
is that we only use 100 arabica beans
a lot of brands will use cheap nasty
robusta beans to bulk out their coffee
we don't do that we use arabica beans
because they grow
2 000 feet above sea level that's a
unique environment
that gives a real delicate sophisticated
flavor to those beans
then it's what crew does with those
coffee beans that counts
we don't like old school burnt bitter
coffee
we prefer a speciality approach to
roasting our beans
which delivers a sophisticated delicate
flavour
with beautiful citrus notes and a great
caramel vibe
crew means no nasty chemicals no
unethical farming practices
crew is 100 organic 100
fair trade and all of this conveniently
delivered to your door
every month
