Oh, Harry! Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.
Mum fancies him.
Make way there, please. Let me by, madam. Thank you.
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.
It can't be.
Harry Potter?
Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam.
Nice big smile Harry, together you and I rate the front page.
Ladies and gentlemen what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me.
Which, incidentally is currently celebrating it's
27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list. He had no idea, that he would in fact be leaving
with my entire collected works,
free of charge.
Now.
Ladies.
Now you give me those, and I'll get them signed, all of you wait outside. That's it.
