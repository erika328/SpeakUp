Oh, no!
Look everyone, Weasley's got himself a Howler.
Go on, Ron.
I ignored one from my Gran once, it was horrible.
Ronald Weasley, how dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted.
Your father's now facing an inquiry at work
and it's entirely your fault!
If you put another toe out of line, we'll

Oh and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making
Gryffindor.
Your father and I are so proud.
