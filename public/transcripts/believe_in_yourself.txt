when people look at me they see what
they want to see and that comes with
a lot of expectations
i know what it's like to be judged and
to be put down
i know what it's like to have other
people form opinions of you without even
knowing you
trying to dim your light i want to say
you are not defined by an instagram
photo by a like by a comment that does
not define you
i want you guys to know that the trick
is is to focus on the love and what i
want you guys to do
every rude comment you get every person
that tries to hurt you
personally or through the internet
i want you to forgive them just forgive
them because they don't even know they
have no idea
there is so much love in this world and
in this stadium do not limit yourself
because of what others expect we all
deserve more than we think and in the
end
nobody remembers those those haters the
comments nobody remembers them they're
just background noise when it's over
nothing defines you about what you leave
behind and what lives you touch on the
way but i'm so grateful for what i have
and i am ready for what comes next in my
life and if you take just one thing from
today let it be this
i want you guys to believe in yourselves
because i believe in you and you guys
need to believe in each other so just do
you
be true to yourself love yourself have
confidence in yourself and everything
will be fine i am so excited for what's
going to come next for you guys thank
you so much
