Hi, I'm George from Pact Coffee 
and today I'm going to show you  
how to brew a mocha using an espresso machine.
First, prepare your coffee shot. You 
want to get about 19 grams of coffee,  
ground very fine for espresso.
Level off the coffee with your 
fingers, remove any coffee from  
the edges and then you want to 
tamp the coffee puck into place.  
Good firm pressure but the most important 
thing is a really nice, flat, even coffee bed.
Before you put the portafilter 
in your espresso machine,  
you just want to purge any steam that's 
built up in the head by hitting the button
and then add the portafilter to the machine 
so you're ready to brew your espresso.
Normally goes in to the left 
and locks in to the right.
Take your cocoa powder and 
add one teaspoon to your cup.
Place your cup underneath and we're ready to brew.
The things to look out for are when it 
start to drop, a really dark syrupy texture,  
a bit like treacle and about 26-30 
seconds of extraction in time.
The amount of liquid in the cup should 
be double the weight of the coffee.  
So 19 grams of coffee equals 38 grams of yield.
Swirl the espresso and the chocolate 
powder together in your cup.
And now it's time to steam the milk.
Always use a full-fat dairy milk 
or a barista version of an oat milk  
and fill your milk jug to just under the spout.
You want to put the steam wand in the centre of 
the milk jug and then tilt the jug just to the  
side. This will allow that whirlpool effect to 
give you that lovely, silky micro-foam texture.
What you want to listen out for is a very 
subtle hissing noise, not a screaming sound  
and only for a few seconds. After 
that you can allow the steam wand  
to go a bit deeper into the milk and 
let that whirlpool do the work for you.
Once that milk is really hot to 
the touch, you can finish steaming.
Always remove any milk residue from your 
steam wand to keep that nice and clean.
Next you will remove any large bubbles just 
by giving it a good firm tap on your counter
and now swirl the milk. And 
the texture you're looking for  
is a really nice, glossy, 
almost paint-like texture.
Okay, time to pour. This is the hard part 
but with practice, you'll get it perfect!
Take your coffee and your cocoa powder mix, 
slight angle and then a nice long pour.
Fill the cup about three quarters 
full. Lovely. Take a pause.
Now, get the spout of the jug really close 
to the surface and really carefully control  
that last part of the process to 
get that lovely latte art texture.
Lovely! Final touch, a little 
sprinkling of cocoa powder on the top
and there you go! That's how 
you brew a delicious mocha.
Thanks for watching this 
Pact Coffee tutorial. Enjoy!
